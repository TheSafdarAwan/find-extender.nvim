## Description

This Plugin extend's the capability of find, till and text manipulation(yank/delete/change)
command's in nvim. With the help of this Plugin you can find multiple characters rather than
one at a time.

üî• This Plugins Effects the following commands:

    f|F (find commands)
    t|T (till commands)
    ;|, (last pattern commands)
    c{t|T|f|f} (change command)
    d{t|T|f|f} (delete command)
    y{t|T|f|f} (yank command)

By default after pressing any of these commands now you have to type two
characters(or more you can specify characters length) rather than One to
go to next position.

#### Why this plugin?

When we are trying to navigate to a point in line we already have a position and the
characters in that position in our mind. So to go exactly to that position. If its on
other line i use relative line number to go to that line number. Then I can use
find-extender.nvim to navigate to that position more efficiently.

This plugin is just extending the capability of neovim default commands.
It doesn't try to imitate the functionality of plugins like:

I want a simple plugin that doesn't clutter up the editor screen with colors and
just does the job of finding on a single line.

## ‚ú® Features

- adds capability to add more characters to finding command's.
- yank/delete/change(y/d/c) text same as finding.
- Highlight the yanked area with color using `require("vim.highlight").range()`.
- timeout to find before the `chars_length` variable lenght has completed.
- provide number like `2` before key to go to second position for the pattern.
  This is universal for y/d/c or t/T/f/F commands.

## üì¶ Installation

Install the theme with your preferred package manager:

[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```vim
Plug 'TheSafdarAwan/find-extender.nvim'
```

[packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

```lua
use {
    opt = true,
    "TheSafdarAwan/find-extender.nvim",
    -- to lazy load this plugin
    keys = {
        { "v", "f" },
        { "v", "F" },
        { "n", "f" },
        { "n", "F" },
        { "n", "T" },
        { "n", "t" },
        { "v", "T" },
        { "v", "t" },
        { "n", "c" },
        { "n", "d" },
        { "n", "y" },
    },
    config = function()
        -- configuration here
    end,
}
```

## Setup
```lua
require("find-extender").setup({
    -- if you want do disable the plugin the set this to false
    enable = true,
    -- how many characters to find for
    chars_length = 2, -- default value is 2 chars
    -- timeout before the find-extender.nvim goes to find the available
    -- characters on timeout after the limit of start_timeout_after_chars
    -- has been reached
    -- timeout in ms
    timeout = false, -- false by default
    -- timeout starting point
    start_timeout_after_chars = 2, -- 2 by default
    -- key maps config
    keymaps = {
        modes = "nv",
        till = { "T", "t" },
        find = { "F", "f" },
        -- to delete, copy or change using t,f or T,F commands
        text_manipulation = { yank = true, delete = true, change = true },
    },
    highlight_on_yank = {
        -- whether to highlight the yanked are or not
        enable = true,
        -- time for which the area will be highlighted
        timeout = 40,
        -- highlight group for the yanked are color
        hl_group = "IncSearch",
    }
})
```

## Commands

There are three commands available.

- FindExtenderDisable
- FindExtenderEnable
- FindExtenderToggle

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can change the amount of characters you want to find by specifying the amount in
this key.

### chars_length

```lua
-- how many characters to find for
chars_length = 2 -- default value is 2 chars
```

Default is _2_ characters and more than that is not recommended because it will slow you down
and that's not what i intend this plugin to do.

### timeout

Timeout before the find-extender.nvim goes to find the characters that you have entered.
before you complete the chars_length character's limit.

```lua
-- timeout in ms
timeout = false -- false by default
```

### start_timeout_after_chars

How many characters after which the timeout should be triggered.

```lua
start_timeout_after_chars = 1, -- 1 by default
```

### ‚å® keymaps

Keymaps are exposed to user if any key you want to remove just remove it from the
tbl

```lua
keymaps = {
    modes = "nv",
    till = { "T", "t" },
    find = { "F", "f" },
},
```

Modes is a string with the modes name initials.

### text_manipulation

Mappings related to the text manipulation like change, delete and yank(copy).
If you want to disable any of the macro then set it to false.

```lua
keymaps = {
    ...,
    -- to delete, copy or change using t,f or T,F commands
    text_manipulation = { yank = true, delete = true, change = true },
}
```

### highlight on yank

These options control the highlight when yanking text.

```lua
highlight_on_yank = {
    -- whether to highlight the yanked are or not
    enable = true,
    -- time for which the area will be highlighted
    timeout = 40,
    -- highlight group for the yanked are color
    hl_group = "IncSearch",
}
```

### Who this Plugin is for?

This Plugin was created so that I can navigate the code more efficiently and edit
the changes i want. But i can't say that everyone will like this plugin.

Some People use vim or neovim for Configuration purposes to change configuration
of servers or maybe you are a member of **Unix Porn** and change configuration
files or your Linux Desktopüêß. Then this plugin might not be useful to you.

This Plugin is for people like me who spend most of their day or night. Writing code
or editing code to get rid of "He who must not be named üêû" lol. Then this Plugin
is right for you.

I can't convince you if this plugin will improve your workflow or not. You would
have to test it for Yourself. And i promise after using this plugin you won't regret
spending your time testing it. This is a huge game changer for me. When moving
in long lines of code.

You might not get feel for it in just one line of code but if you use it for an
Hour of your time when you are writing code. Then you will know the capability of
this plugin.

### üåÉ Story Behind this Plugin:

I wrote a simple function for `f` command that got two characters and then got
you to the next position for those characters. But after doing that i got used to
it And thought maybe i can also map the other pattern finding commands like this
for that i had to separate this into its own file and from that it grow into a
Plugin which i shared on reddit people liked it. And from then on i added some
new functionality to it. And now its a whole plugin. Which i didn't anticipated
this would become one day.
